## 👩‍💼 Business Analyst Role

### 🧩 Business Problem

The marketing team lacked visibility into how their email campaigns were performing over time. They were sending thousands of emails without knowing:
- How many were opened or clicked?
- How many bounced or failed to deliver?
- Which days/months had the best response?

This limited their ability to improve engagement, targeting, and ROI from campaigns.

As a Business Analyst, I:

- Defined key KPIs to measure campaign success:
  - Click-Through Rate (CTR)
  - Bounce Rate
  - Open Rate
  - Delivery Rate
- Interpreted trends and patterns across time (year, month, day)
- Identified gaps in campaign effectiveness and offered actionable recommendations

  ➤ Recommended avoiding campaign launches on Saturdays and Sundays
